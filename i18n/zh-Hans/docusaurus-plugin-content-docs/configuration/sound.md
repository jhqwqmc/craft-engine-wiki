:::info

When you use the `/playsound` command to play a sound, it should actually be referred to as a sound event, while the actual sounds are located under the sounds list. You can check the Minecraft Wiki to understand the effects corresponding to each parameter. The plugin does not provide extensive descriptions here because the Minecraft Wiki already explains each part very clearly, and CraftEngine uses the same configuration option names as those described in the wiki.
