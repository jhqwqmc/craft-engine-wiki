Once a `configured feature` is specified, the **Sapling Block** can grow into the designated tree configuration during a random tick event.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:palm_sapling:
    behavior:
      type: sapling_block
      # This requires you to register a custom tree configuration with data pack
      # To prevent errors, we use tree feature from vanilla here
      feature: minecraft:fancy_oak
      bone-meal-success-chance: 0.45
      grow-speed: 0.7  # (0-1)
```

:::tip

The more stage values a sapling has, the longer its required growth time.
