Please note that reloading the plugin will not affect furniture that already placed! You will need to restart the server or reload the chunks to apply new configurations to existing furniture. The plugin utilizes caching to enhance the performance of the furniture. Forcibly reloading furniture that is already loaded on the server without caution could have a significant impact on the server's stability.

In the future, the plugin may consider introducing related unsafe flags for forced reloading, but certainly not at this moment.
