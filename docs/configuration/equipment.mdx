## Introduction

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={require('/img/equipment_1.png').default} alt="" />
</div>

CraftEngine offers two ways to create custom equipment. One method is based on **Trim** (for Minecraft 1.20+), and the other uses the **Equippable component** (introduced in 1.21.2).

:::warning

Please note all configurations below pertain to equipment settings, not individual item specifications. To apply these equipment configurations to your armor items, please refer to **[this documentation](item/settings.mdx#equipment)**.

```yaml
items:
  my:custom_helmet:
    settings:
      equipment:
        asset-id: my:custom_armor
equipments:
  my:custom_armor:
    ...
```

**Regarding 3D Helmets:**

The creation method for 3D helmets is completely unrelated to **equipment.** Since many users have encountered difficulties when creating 3D helmets, I'm here to explain the correct way to create them and clarify some potential misconceptions you may have.

<details>
  <summary>3D Helmet</summary>

  Armor items inherently come with an `equippable` component, which includes an option called `asset_id`. When this option is specified, Minecraft uses a **hardcoded renderer** to display the designated armor texture. This means that even if you assign a custom 3D item model to a diamond helmet-based item, it will still be rendered using the default **diamond helmet armor renderer** when worn by a player.

  ![](/img/3d_helmet_1.png)

  To fix this, you must disable the hardcoded renderer and allow the helmet to use the default item renderer instead.

  ### Solution 1 (For 1.21.2+):

  Override the `equippable` component and remove the `asset_id` option. Here’s an example:

  ```yaml
  items:
    default:my_3d_helmet:
      material: diamond_helmet
      data:
        equippable:
          slot: head
  ```

  ### Solution 2 (For 1.20+):

  Use `client-bound-material` to modify how the helmet renders on the client side without affecting its server-side functionality. Here’s an example:

  ```yaml
  items:
    default:my_3d_helmet:
      material: diamond_helmet
      client-bound-material: paper
  ```

## Component Based
<Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**1.21.2+**</Highlight><Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**Recommended**</Highlight>

```yaml
equipments:
  # the equipment asset id
  default:topaz:
    type: component
    # 'namespace:path' resolves to assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/equipment/<layer_type>/<path>.png.
    # 
    # Example: minecraft:topaz
    #               ↓
    # assets/minecraft/textures/entity/equipment/humanoid/topaz.png
    humanoid: "minecraft:topaz"

    # other layer types
    # assets/minecraft/textures/entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings/topaz.png
    humanoid-leggings: "minecraft:topaz"

    # more layer types, based on your needs
    # assets/minecraft/textures/entity/equipment/happy_ghast_body/topaz.png
    happy-ghast-body: "minecraft:topaz"
```

The image below demonstrates the mapping between configurations and actual texture paths. If a layer type contains hyphens ("-"), you must replace them with underscores ("_") in the path. Example `humanoid-leggings` -> `humanoid_leggings`

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src={require('/img/equipment_3.png').default} alt="" />
</div>


**Supported layer types:**

* humanoid
* humanoid-leggings
* wings
* wolf-body
* horse-body
* llama-body
* pig-saddle
* strider-saddle
* camel-saddle
* horse-saddle
* donkey-saddle
* mule-saddle
* skeleton-horse-saddle
* zombie-horse-saddle
* happy-ghast-body

❓️**Q:** Why doesn't CraftEngine let users use random texture paths and relocate them when generating the resource pack?

✔️ **A:** I want users to follow Minecraft's resource pack standards - I'll only allow custom paths if Mojang breaks their own rules. Then the plugin will handle version-specific paths for you.

:::tip

You can also set it up as a configuration block like this for some extra options

```yaml

equipments:
  default:topaz:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      texture: "minecraft:leather"
      dyeable:
        color-when-undyed: -6265536 # leather color
      # for elytra texture
      use-player-texture: false
```
:::

:::tip

You can also combine multiple textures using lists. Here are two examples:

```yaml
equipments:
  custom:partialy_dyeable_armor:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:dyeable_part"
        dyeable:
          color-when-undyed: -6265536
      - texture: "minecraft:undyeable_part"
```

```yaml
equipments:
  custom:red_flower_wreath:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:wreath"
      - texture: "minecraft:red_flower"
  custom:yellow_flower_wreath:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:wreath"
      - texture: "minecraft:yellow_flower"
  custom:white_flower_wreath:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:wreath"
      - texture: "minecraft:white_flower"
```

## Trim Based
<Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**1.20+**</Highlight><Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**Iris/Optifine Shader Compatibility**</Highlight><Highlight color="#e03f26ff">**Trim Not Applicable**</Highlight>

When CraftEngine removes a vanilla armor's base texture, the armor becomes completely transparent when worn. By applying custom trims to this invisible armor, we can achieve custom armor textures. However, this approach has one limitation - the armor can no longer receive additional trims afterward.

<details>
  <summary>Fix the "removed" armor</summary>

  Q: Will sacrificed armor still display normally? Does this mean I can't use chainmail armor at all?

  A: CraftEngine anticipated this scenario. The solution is surprisingly simple, at least for CraftEngine - we apply a special trim pattern to vanilla chainmail armor to preserve its original appearance. This is achieved through CraftEngine's exclusive `client-bound-data` feature.

  By default, the plugin has preconfigured vanilla armor sacrificial options in `config.yml`. These settings will only take effect when you have configured at least one trim-based armor.

```yaml
# config.yml
equipment:
  sacrificed-vanilla-armor:
    type: chainmail
    asset-id: minecraft:chainmail
    humanoid: minecraft:trims/entity/humanoid/chainmail
    humanoid-leggings: minecraft:trims/entity/humanoid_leggings/chainmail

# legacy_armor/configuration/chainmail.yml
items:
  minecraft:chainmail_helmet:
    client-bound-data:
      trim:
        pattern: chainmail # the pattern that preserves its original appearance
        material: custom # a hardcoded material type
      hide-tooltip:
        - trim
  ...leggings, chestplate and boots
```
</details>

This configures a trim-based armor set. The texture paths have no strict requirements - CraftEngine will automatically relocate texture directories for you.

```yaml
equipments:
  # the equipment asset id
  default:topaz:
    type: trim
    humanoid: minecraft:entity/equipment/humanoid/topaz
    humanoid-leggings: minecraft:entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings/topaz
```

:::caution

Trim-based armor only supports the **humanoid** and **humanoid-leggings** model types.

## Core Shader Based

CraftEngine currently has no plans to implement custom armor based on core shaders. This approach would inherently rely on leather armor as a base, which would break when used with third-party shaders - though it does offer trim compatibility. However, given that as of 2025, over 90% of servers now run on version 1.21.2+, this feature will likely never be implemented.
