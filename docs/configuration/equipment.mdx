## Introduction

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

CraftEngine offers two ways to create custom equipment. One method is based on **Trim** (for 1.20 and above), and the other uses the **Equippable Component** (for 1.21.2 and above).

:::warning

**Applying Equipment to Items:**

To apply these equipments to your armor items, go to **[equipment settings](item/settings.mdx#equipment)**.

**Regarding 3D Helmets:**

The creation method for 3D helmets is completely unrelated to **equipment.** Since many users have encountered difficulties when creating 3D helmets, I'm here to explain the correct way to create them and clarify some potential misconceptions you may have.

<details>
  <summary>3D Helmet</summary>

  Armor items inherently come with an `equippable` component, which includes an option called `asset_id`. When this option is specified, Minecraft uses a **armor renderer** to display the designated armor texture. This means that even if you assign a custom 3D item model to a diamond helmet-based item, it will still be rendered using the default **armor renderer** when worn by a player.

  To fix this, you must disable the armor renderer and allow the helmet to use the default renderer instead.

  ### Solution 1 (For 1.21.2+):

  Override the `equippable` component and remove the `asset_id` option. Here’s an example:

  ```yaml
  items:
    default:my_3d_helmet:
      material: diamond_helmet
      data:
        equippable:
          slot: head
  ```

  ### Solution 2 (For 1.20+):

  Use `client-bound-material` to modify how the helmet renders on the client side without affecting its server-side functionality. Here’s an example:

  ```yaml
  items:
    default:my_3d_helmet:
      material: diamond_helmet
      client-bound-material: paper
  ```

## Component Based
<Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**1.21.2+**</Highlight><Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**Recommended**</Highlight>

```yaml
equipments:
  # the equipment asset id
  default:topaz:
    type: component
    humanoid: "minecraft:entity/equipment/humanoid/topaz"
    humanoid-leggings: "minecraft:entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings/topaz"
    # Add more layer types based on your needs
    happy-ghast-body: "minecraft:entity/equipment/happy_ghast_body/topaz"
```

**Supported layer types:**

* humanoid
* humanoid-leggings
* wings
* wolf-body
* horse-body
* llama-body
* pig-saddle
* strider-saddle
* camel-saddle
* horse-saddle
* donkey-saddle
* mule-saddle
* skeleton-horse-saddle
* zombie-horse-saddle
* happy-ghast-body
* camel-husk-saddle
* nautilus-body

:::tip

You can also set it up as a configuration section like this for some extra options

```yaml

equipments:
  default:topaz:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      texture: "minecraft:leather"
      dyeable:
        color-when-undyed: -6265536 # leather color
      # elytra texture
      use-player-texture: false
```

You can also combine multiple textures using lists. Here are two examples:

```yaml
equipments:
  custom:partialy_dyeable_armor:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:dyeable_part"
        dyeable:
          color-when-undyed: -6265536
      - texture: "minecraft:undyeable_part"
```

```yaml
equipments:
  custom:red_flower_wreath:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:wreath"
      - texture: "minecraft:red_flower"
  custom:yellow_flower_wreath:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:wreath"
      - texture: "minecraft:yellow_flower"
  custom:white_flower_wreath:
    type: component
    humanoid:
      - texture: "minecraft:wreath"
      - texture: "minecraft:white_flower"
```

## Trim Based
<Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**1.20+**</Highlight><Highlight color="#0d9622ff">**Iris/Optifine Shader Compatibility**</Highlight><Highlight color="#e03f26ff">**Trim Not Applicable**</Highlight>

When CraftEngine removes a vanilla armor's base texture, the armor becomes completely transparent when worn. By applying custom trims to this invisible armor, we can achieve custom armor textures. However, this approach has one limitation - the armor can no longer receive additional trims afterward.

```yaml
equipments:
  # the equipment asset id
  default:topaz:
    type: trim
    humanoid: minecraft:entity/equipment/humanoid/topaz
    humanoid-leggings: minecraft:entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings/topaz
```

  You can fix vanilla chainmail armor by running `/ce resource enable legacy_armor`. The solution is surprisingly simple - we apply a special trim pattern to vanilla chainmail armor to preserve its original appearance.

:::caution

Trim-based armor only supports the **humanoid** and **humanoid-leggings** model types.

## Core Shader Based

CraftEngine currently has no plans to implement custom armor based on core shaders. This approach would inherently rely on leather armor as a base, which would break when used with third-party shaders - though it does offer trim compatibility. However, given that as of 2025, over 90% of servers now run on version 1.21.2+, this feature will likely never be implemented.
