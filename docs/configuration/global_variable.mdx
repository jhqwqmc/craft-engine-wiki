## Introduction

A global variable is a type of variable that can be accessed in any context and is widely applicable in various scenarios such as expressions and item data.

Here is a basic example, where tags in the format `<arg:0>` are optional parameters that can be dynamically provided by the caller:

```yaml
global-variables:
  test: "<!i><#FF8C00><arg:0>'s <arg:1>"
items:
  default:topaz_rod:
    client-bound-data:
      item-name: "<global:test:'<arg:player.name>':'<i18n:item.topaz_rod>'>"
```

CraftEngine's global variables are also accessible to other plugins, though it should be noted that their implementation operates through text replacement at the packet level. **This approach does not interfere with the functional logic or internal operations of the recipient plugins**.

```yaml
global-variables:
  coin_without_shadow: "<!shadow><image:default:icons>"
```

```yaml
# Hologram configuration in another plugin
line: "<global:coin_without_shadow> My coins: %vault_eco_balance%"
```
