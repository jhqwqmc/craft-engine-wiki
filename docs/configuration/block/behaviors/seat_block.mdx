```yml
blocks:
  default:sofa:
    behavior:
      type: seat_block
      seats:
        - 0,0,0 0   # x,y,z [angle]
```

```yml
blocks:
  default:sofa:
    behavior:
      type: seat_block
      seats:
        - 0,0,0   
```

:::tip
The values of x, y, and z are automatically adjusted based on the block's facing property.

You will notice that there is an additional `0` after `0,0,0`. If you fill in this parameter, it means the player's rotation angle in the seat is limited. You can try adding/removing this parameter and looking around in the chair to feel the difference.
