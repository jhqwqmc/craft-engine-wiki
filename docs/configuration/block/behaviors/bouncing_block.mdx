**Bouncing Block** let you bounce off the block.

```yml
blocks:
  default:sofa:
    behavior:
      type: bouncing_block
      bounce-height: 0.66 # Bounce Height
      # This option uses a somewhat hacky method to synchronize the player's position.
      # If the block state you used on the client side behaves like some vanilla bouncing blocks (such as beds or slime blocks), you can set this to false.
      sync-player-position: true
      fall-damage-multiplier: 0.5 # Fall damage multiplier
```
