**Toggleable Lamp Block** allow blocks to toggle their `lit` state when activated by a redstone signal while holding the `powered` property,
or when enabled with `can-open-with-hand`, by right-clicking to toggle the `lit` state.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:copper_coil:
    behavior:
      type: toggleable_lamp_block
      can-open-with-hand: false # When set to true, the powered property is optional
```
