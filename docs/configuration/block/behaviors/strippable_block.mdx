**Strippable Block** is a type of block that can be stripped by right-clicking with an axe, and it is primarily used for tree logs.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:palm_log:
    behavior:
      type: strippable_block
      stripped: default:stripped_palm_log
      excluded-properties: []  # properties to ignore when transforming
```
