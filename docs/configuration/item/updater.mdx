## Introduction

Sometimes when configuring items, we may overlook certain aspects and need to adjust players' existing items. This is where an item updater comes into playâ€”it updates the data of the actual items on the server.

Due to how the updater works (by replacing items during specific events), it incurs some performance overhead. You can configure in **config.yml** which events should trigger the item updater. By default, all these triggers are disabledâ€”you can enable them as needed.

```yaml
item:
  update-triggers:
    click-in-inventory: false # this option won't work for players in creative mode
    drop: false
    pick-up: false
    ...more
```

:::tip
If you only need to update visual elements of an itemâ€”such as custom-model-data, item-model, lore, or nameâ€”it is recommended to use `client-bound-data` instead of an item updater.
:::

To configure an item updater, simply add a new `updater` section following the format below. By default, items have a version number of 0, and the plugin will attempt to update them to the latest version.

In the example below:
- If an item's version is 0, both update logic 1 and 2 will be executed.
- If an item's version is 1, only logic 2 will be applied.

```yaml
items:
  default:my_sword:
    material: wooden_sword
    updater:
      1:
        type: apply_data
        data:
          item-name: First Update
      # You can apply multiple updaters simultaneously using a list format.
      2:
        - type: apply_data
          data:
            lore: 
              - "Second Update"
        - type: transmute
          material: wooden_sword
```

## Updaters

### apply_data

Apply any valid [item data](./data.mdx) supported by CraftEngine

```yaml
type: apply_data
data:
  item-name: First Update
```

### transmute

Replace an item's base material with another item's while preserving all its components/NBT data.

```yaml
type: transmute
material: wooden_sword
```

### reset

Update the item to its latest state immediately while preserving specified components/NBT tags

```yaml
type: reset
# 1.20.5+
keep-components:
  - minecraft:enchantments
# legacy versions
keep-tags:
  - Enchantments
```
