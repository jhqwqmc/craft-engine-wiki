## Introduction

**Wall Block Item** can only be placed on the side of a block, all other behaviors are identical to the [Block Item](block_item.mdx).

```yaml
items:
  default:palm_sapling:
    behavior:
      type: wall_block_item
      block: default:palm_sapling
      # hanging: true # By default this is undefined; undefined means using the default behavior.
                      # When set to true or false, placement will depend on the player's facing direction to determine whether it is placed facing upward or downward.
```
