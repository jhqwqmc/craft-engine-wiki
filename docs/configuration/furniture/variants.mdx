## Introduction

Furniture supports three variants: ground, ceiling, and wall.
You can employ distinct appearances and collision box schemes for different variants.
For instance, a potted plant furniture item may stand upright when placed on the ground,
dangle with a rope when hung from the ceiling,
and be supported by a wooden plank when mounted on the wall—much like vanilla bell block.

:::tip
You can configure multiple variants simultaneously for a single piece of furniture.
:::

Below, I will use the ground mode as an example to explain how to configure a basic variant.

```yaml
furniture:
  default:bench:
    variants:
      ground:
        # create offsets for the drops so they won't spawn in blocks
        loot-spawn-offset: 0,0,0
        # Supports External Models Here
        # model-engine: blueprint_id
        # better-model: blueprint_id
        elements:
          - item: default:bench
            display-transform: NONE
            billboard: FIXED
            position: 0.5,0,0
            translation: 0,0.5,0
            apply-dyed-color: true # default: true
            # glow-color: 255,255,255 # glow color: r,g,b
        hitboxes:
          - type: interaction # non-collision hitbox
            can-use-item-on: false # default: false
            can-be-hit-by-projectile: false # default: false
            blocks-building: false # default: true
            position: 0,0,0
            width: 1
            height: 2
            # 'width'/'height' can be simplified to 'scale'
            # scale: 1,2
            interactive: true # whether the interaction entity is interactive
            seats:
              - 0,0,-0.1 0
```

There are two sections: `elements`, and `hitboxes`

The `elements` section defines which items compose the furniture (you can configure multiple items for a single piece of furniture, each with different display modes).  \
The `hitboxes` section specifies the collision volume of the furniture.

## Elements

An `element` is each item that constitutes the appearance of the furniture. For most furniture, a single item suffices.
However, if you wish to create a more intricate piece of furniture, you can assemble it from multiple items.
For example, a holographic projection could be divided into two items: a base and the projection itself.
The base could have a fixed orientation, while the projection could be set to always face the player.

```yaml
elements:
  - item: default:bench
    display-transform: none # none / third_person_left_hand / third_person_right_hand
                            # first_person_left_hand / first_person_right_hand
                            # head / gui / ground / fixed
    billboard: fixed  # fixed / vertical / horizontal / center
    position: 0.5,0,0
    translation: 0,0.5,0
    scale: 1 # scale: 1,2,1
    apply-dyed-color: true
    glow-color: 255,255,255
    # rotation support 3 formats
    rotation: 45  # Y axis
    rotation: 45,45,0  # Euler angle
    rotation: 0,0,0.7071,0.7071  # Quaternions  https://quaternions.online/
```

:::warning
Please note the distinction between `position` and `translation`. `position` alters the coordinate location of the corresponding display entity, whereas `translation` is a displacement attribute of the display entity itself.
:::

:::danger
For wall variants of furniture, you need to use `position` for slight offsets; otherwise, the furniture may turn black in certain directions. This is related to how Minecraft renders entities.
:::

## Hitboxes

The `hitbox` is the interaction entity sent to the player, and you can visualize its effect by using the F3+B debug screen.

### Interaction

```yaml
hitboxes:
  - type: interaction # non-collision hitbox
    can-use-item-on: false # default: false
    can-be-hit-by-projectile: false # default: false
    blocks-building: false # default: true
    position: 0,0,0
    width: 1
    height: 2
    # 'width'/'height' can be simplified to 'scale'
    # scale: 1,2
    interactive: true # whether the interaction entity is interactive
    seats:
      - 0,0,-0.1 0
```

### Shulker

```yaml
hitboxes:
  - type: shulker # hard-collision hitbox
    can-use-item-on: true # default: true
    can-be-hit-by-projectile: true # default: true
    blocks-building: true # default: true
    position: 1,0,0
    scale: 1 # 1.20.5+
    peek: 0 # 0~100
    # Relative direction. north = facing the player
    direction: UP # up/down/north/west/east/south
    interaction-entity: true # whether to summon another interaction entity
    interactive: true # whether the interaction entity is interactive
    seats:
      - 1,0,-0.1 0
```

### Happy Ghast

```yaml
hitboxes:
  - type: happy_ghast # hard/soft-collision hitbox
    can-use-item-on: true # default: true
    can-be-hit-by-projectile: true # default: true
    blocks-building: true # default: true
    hard-collision: true # default: true
    position: 1,0,0
    scale: 0.25 # default: 1
    seats:
      - 1,0,-0.1 0
```

### Custom

```yaml
hitboxes:
  - type: custom # mainly used for soft-collision hitbox
    position: 1,0,0
    scale: 5 # 1.20.5+
    # You can use any entity here
    entity-type: slime # default: slime
    seats:
      - 1,0,-0.1 0
```

:::tip
A single `hitbox` can be configured with multiple seats. If the seats of multiple `hitboxes` are positioned at the same location, it is equivalent to having only one seat.
:::

:::info
The position of a `seat` is determined by a location and a rotation, separated by a space in the configuration.

```
0,0,0 0
```

You may also choose not to configure a rotation angle, allowing players to rotate freely to any angle while seated.

```
0,0,0
```

## Entity Culling

You can individually control whether entity culling is enabled for each furniture item

```yaml
ground:
  entity-culling: false # Disabled
```

Once entity culling is enabled, you can configure the culling parameters

```yaml
ground:
  entity-culling:
    aabb: -0.5,0,-0.5,0.5,2,0.5 # x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2. Manual configuration of AABB is not recommended; the plugin will calculate it automatically.
    view-distance: 64 # View distance culling. -1 means unlimited distance.
                      # However, setting this to -1 is not recommended when ray tracing is enabled,
                      # as it results in excessive algorithm path length and performance impact.
    ray-tracing: false # Whether to enable ray tracing culling.
```

## External Models

You can also use external models from ModelEngine/BetterModel

```yaml
furniture:
  default:bench:
    variants:
      ground:
        model-engine: blueprint_id
        better-model: blueprint_id
```
