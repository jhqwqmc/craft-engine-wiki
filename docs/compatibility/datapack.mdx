## Block State Provider

CraftEngine allows you to use custom blocks in datapacks, enabling terrain generation, trees, ore veins, and more through datapack configuration.

Here's a tree configuration example for Minecraft 1.21.4 using CraftEngine:

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:tree",
  "config": {
    "ignore_vines": true,
    "force_dirt": false,
    "minimum_size": {
      "type": "minecraft:two_layers_feature_size",
      "min_clipped_height": 10,
      "limit": 1,
      "lower_size": 0,
      "upper_size": 2
    },
    "dirt_provider": {
      "type": "minecraft:simple_state_provider",
      "state": {
        "Name": "minecraft:sand"
      }
    },
    "trunk_provider": {
      "type": "craftengine:simple_state_provider",
      "state": {
        "Name": "default:palm_log"
        "Properties": {
          "axis": "y"
        }
      }
    },
    "foliage_provider": {
      "type": "craftengine:simple_state_provider",
      "state": {
        "Name": "default:palm_leaves",
        "Properties": {
          "distance": "7",
          "persistent": "false",
          "waterlogged": "false"
        }
      }
    },
    "trunk_placer": {
      "type": "minecraft:straight_trunk_placer",
      "base_height": 6,
      "height_rand_a": 5,
      "height_rand_b": 0
    },
    "foliage_placer": {
      "type": "minecraft:cherry_foliage_placer",
      "radius": 5,
      "offset": 0,
      "height": 4,
      "wide_bottom_layer_hole_chance": 0.8,
      "corner_hole_chance": 1,
      "hanging_leaves_chance": 0.8,
      "hanging_leaves_extension_chance": 0.4
    },
    "decorators": []
  }
}
```

:::tip
Compared to the native Minecraft datapack, the main difference is that the namespace has been changed from `minecraft` to `craftengine`, while all other configuration formats remain the same. Currently, CraftEngine supports the following block state types:

- `craftengine:simple_state_provider`
- `craftengine:weighted_state_provider`
- `craftengine:rotated_block_provider`
- `craftengine:randomized_int_state_provider`

The usage and effects of these types are consistent with their counterparts in the native Minecraft datapack.

## Configured feature

When placing double-height plants or other multi-state blocks, Minecraft's native placement logic suffers from hardcoded limitations that often lead to errors such as only generating the bottom half. To address this, CraftEngine introduces a new configured feature type called `craftengine:simple_block`. While its usage is similar to `minecraft:simple_block`, it provides enhanced compatibility and better handling for multi-state blocks within CraftEngine.

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:random_patch",
  "config": {
    "feature": {
      "feature": {
        "type": "craftengine:simple_block",
        "config": {
          "to_place": {
            "type": "craftengine:simple_state_provider",
            "state": {
              "Name": "default:palm_door"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "placement": [
        {
          "type": "minecraft:block_predicate_filter",
          "predicate": {
            "type": "minecraft:matching_blocks",
            "blocks": "minecraft:air"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "tries": 96,
    "xz_spread": 7,
    "y_spread": 3
  }
}
```

:::caution

Please note: custom IDs are currently only resolved for feature types registered directly through CraftEngine. Due to some hardcoded vanilla limitations, you may need to use the internal block ID (e.g., `craftengine:custom_0`) in certain contexts where the CraftEngine ID is not recognized.

Click [**here**](../reference/commands.mdx#get-block-internal-id) to learn how to obtain the real block ID of a custom block.

## Loots

When you want to use items from CraftEngine as loot, simply configure them in the following way. This method applies to chests, block drops, fishing loot, and more.

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:fishing",
  "pools": [
    {
      "bonus_rolls": 0.0,
      "entries": [
        {
          "type": "craftengine:item",
          "name": "default:palm_log",
          "weight": 60
        },
        {
          "type": "craftengine:item",
          "name": "default:chinese_lantern",
          "weight": 25
        },
        {
          "type": "minecraft:item",
          "name": "minecraft:tropical_fish",
          "weight": 2
        },
        {
          "type": "minecraft:item",
          "name": "minecraft:pufferfish",
          "weight": 13
        }
      ],
      "rolls": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "random_sequence": "minecraft:gameplay/fishing/fish"
}
```
