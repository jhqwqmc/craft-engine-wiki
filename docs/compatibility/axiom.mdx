:::caution
Due to changes in version 0.0.63.8, client mod are temporarily incompatible with this version and all subsequent versions.
:::

First, ensure your server has [axiom-paper](https://modrinth.com/plugin/axiom-paper-plugin) installed.

Then download and install the [craft-engine-client-mod](https://github.com/Xiao-MoMi/craft-engine-client-mod/releases).

After launching the client. You need to copy the corresponding files from the server plugin's configuration folder to the client's **mod config folder**, then restart your client to apply the changes.

For the server, simply enable the **`generate-mod-assets`** option in config.yml, and it will automatically generate client-side resources compatible with the mod.
