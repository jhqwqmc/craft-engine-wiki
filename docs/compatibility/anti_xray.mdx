CraftEngine natively supports Paper's anti-Xray feature. You just need to obtain the real block IDs of the corresponding blocks and fill them in, and it will take effect.

```yaml
anticheat:
  anti-xray:
    enabled: false
    engine-mode: 1
    hidden-blocks:
    - copper_ore
    - deepslate_copper_ore
    - raw_copper_block
    - gold_ore
    - craftengine:note_block_56
    - craftengine:tripwire_19
```
