## Your Big First Step

Thanks for choosing CraftEngine - that's a smart move you won't regret! Welcome to CraftEngine's very first tutorial! I bet you're itching to create your first item already. But before we jump into that, let me walk you through how CraftEngine's <Highlight color="#3CB371">**config folders**</Highlight> are organized.

:::tip

You can click on the folders, and don't miss the '?' next to each file‚Äîit's clickable as well!

### Set Up the Folder Structure

Go ahead and find our <Highlight color="#3CB371">**first_item.yml**</Highlight> in the folder above, then create the same directory structure. Just a note - you don't need to make the pack.yml file for this tutorial.

<details>
  <summary>Tips</summary>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `tutorial` folder \
2Ô∏è‚É£ Inside it, make a `configuration` folder \
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a new file named `first_item.yml` there

</details>

### Create Your First Item Config

Now copy this config into your YML file. After saving, just run `/ce reload` and try getting your item with `/ce item get tutorial:diamond` in the game.

```yaml
items:
  tutorial:diamond:
    material: diamond
```

### Add Basic Item Info

Right now it's just a plain diamond - let's spice it up! We'll give it a custom name and description. Try this config:

```yaml
items:
  tutorial:diamond:
    material: diamond
    data:
      item-name: "<blue>Shiny Diamond"
      lore:
        - "<!i><red>Epic Items"
```

![](/img/first_item.png)


:::tip

Don‚Äôt forget to **reload** your config! \
(Use `/ce reload` to apply changes)

About `<!i>`: It removes italic formatting (lore text is purple & italic by default).

### Dynamic Item Rendering

<Highlight color="#f2184eff">**Premium Exclusive**</Highlight>

How do I update an item's description? Just use CraftEngine's special client-bound-data feature! Unlike regular data, this only shows up for players - the server won't even know it exists.

```yaml
items:
  tutorial:diamond:
    material: diamond
    client-bound-data:
      item-name: "<blue>Shiny Diamond"
      lore:
        - "<!i><white>Common Items"
```

If you still have that diamond you just created, try out client-bound-data! Just trigger a server-side item update - drop it or move it in a container - and bam! Fresh new look. If it's not updating, try switching to Survival mode.

:::caution

`client-bound-data` means the server won't have the real data. If you use it for item-name, any server-side name checks will fail. Use it wisely based on your server needs.

Stuff like `max_damage` and `attribute_modifiers` shouldn't be client-bound-data. They change real server gameplay, and you'll get weird visual mismatches
