The good part? It's completely free - just needs your existing server. Perfect for testing and development. But unless you've got killer bandwidth, don't use this for production environments. Resource pack downloads will hog your server's connection and might lag out other players.

<DiffViewer>
{`
resource-pack:
    delivery:
      hosting:
        - type: "self"
-       ip: "localhost"
+       ip: "Your Server Ip" # for instance 111.222.333.444
          port: 8163
          protocol: "http"
          deny-non-minecraft-request: true
          one-time-token: true
          rate-limit:
            max-requests: 5
            reset-interval: 20 # seconds
`}
</DiffViewer>

:::info

The `deny-non-minecraft-request` setting blocks all requests from non-Minecraft clients. \
As for `one-time-token`, it generates a single-use, time-limited download link for each player.

You can avoid using IPv4 addresses for resource pack URLs by setting a full/complete URL instead.
```yaml
- type: "self"
  ip: "111.222.333.444"
  port: 8163
  url: "https://mydomain.com:8163/"
  # ...more options
```

:::caution

Don't use `https` if you don't have an SSL certificate.
