## Advancements

The reason CraftEngine had to create custom advancements is because vanilla Minecraft tightly couples progressions with recipes. In the base game, certain recipes are literally locked behind advancements - like how you only get the boat recipe after entering water for the first time.

## Built-in Simple Terrain Generator

Look, some plugins try to do simple ore/feature generation using Bukkit's ChunkLoadEvent. But here's the problem - not only does this kill performance, it creates this ridiculous situation where you get massive ore piles crammed into single chunks instead of proper, natural-looking veins that span across multiple chunks.

You've got options for terrain/ore/structure generation - stuff like Iris, Terra, or data packs will work. Since CraftEngine injects real serverside blocks, technically all terrain plugins should be compatible. But if you want, you could also wait for CraftEngine to roll out its own solution down the road.

## Item Predicates

Through Item Predicates, the matching rules for items in recipes can be controlled more precisely, such as an enchanted sword with "at least Sharpness V" or a potion with specific effect values.
