## Full vanilla behavior compatibility

CraftEngine lets you repurpose unused note blocks, tripwires, etc. as custom block states‚Äîwithout messing with their original server-side mechanics. 
No need to sacrifice vanilla features for custom content. Get the best of both worlds! üéÆ‚ú®

CraftEngine registers real blocks‚Äîso you can use them directly in your datapacks! üå≥‚ú® Want to generate custom trees, or even redesign the End? Now you can. Full vanilla compatibility, endless possibilities."

:::caution
Let's be real - CraftEngine is the only plugin that gets datapacks right. Some other plugins tell you to **just use equivalent vanilla blocks** as substitutes for custom blocks. That's straight-up wrong!

Datapack transformations like rotations and mirroring will completely break those workarounds, leaving you with totally different blocks than you intended. Besides, using real note blocks for custom trees will cause the leaves to wither and drop. Once you attempt to create a custom tree, you'll only end up with a frustrating result.

CraftEngine, on the other hand, creates true custom blocks. Your multi-directional blocks can be properly rotated within the data pack, and your custom logs are real logs that will keep leaves alive.

## Resource Pack Protection

<Highlight color="#f2184eff">**Premium Exclusive**</Highlight>

CraftEngine employs advanced obfuscation to safeguard your assets - we make sure they're only readable by Minecraft clients. Any extraction attempts (Bandizip, JD-GUI, etc.) will fail catastrophically.

Our protection goes further with:
- Secure obfuscation that permanently alters file structures
- Proprietary texture atlas algorithm merging all models into mega-textures
‚Üí Reduces pack size and makes asset theft practically harder

## Client-Side Item Components

CraftEngine lets you dynamically customize item names, descriptions, and visuals using client-side components. This means you can update item textures in real-time and even show different items to different players.
